To launch the application
 First install all dependencies for Client and Api folders separately
 - For both Api and Client, Node.js needs to be installed on the system can be found here: https://nodejs.org/en/. I used v8.9.1
 - For Api run "npm install" in cmd or similar, inside folder to install dependencies.
 - For Client run "yarn install" in cmd or similar, inside folder to install dependencies.

 Now you should be good to go!
 - For Api to start run "npm start", then the rest-api should be ready on port 8000.
 - For Client to start run "yarn serve", then the frontend should be launched on port 8080.
 - To use the application navigate to localhost:8080 inside your browser, and it should be there to be found. :D
